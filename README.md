# Simualting reactions in fluid flow using COMSOL

The COMSOL model generates a concentration distribution of products from a first order reaction occuring in flow within a microfluidic device. This can be used to predict the outcome when the device is used for time-resolving cryo-EM.

Continue reading to find out more about the system and generate a text file of paramters which can be directly inserted into the COMSOL model to personalise you model. Press the **RUN BUTTON** as you read.

<u>Geometry</u>

The microfluidic device includes two inlets from which your reactants are inserted into the device. The two will be completely mixed and allowed to incubate before exiting the device, and used for cryo-EM and imaging.
